# KillProof Module

### About

This Blish HUD module relies on the [KillProof.me](https://killproof.me/) service to help automate or assist with checking the raid "kill proofs" of members of your party.  This module is used with [Blish HUD](https://github.com/blish-hud/Blish-HUD), a Guild Wars 2 overlay.

If combined with the [Blish HUD ArcDPS Bridge](https://github.com/blish-hud/arcdps-bhud), it can automatically list members of your party that have signed up for Killproof.me so you don't have to search manually for their profile.
